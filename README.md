:warning: **Please note that you mustn't open PRs that contains the answers to this repo!**

However, PRs with the fixes or proposals are welcomed!

## Prepare and test

1. Install Node.js
2. Fork this repository: <https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/core-js-oop>
3. Clone your newly created repo: `https://github.com/<%your_github_username%>/core-js-oop/`
4. Go to folder `core-js-oop`
5. To install all dependencies use `npm install`
6. Each task is usually one or more classes:

   ```javascript
   /**
    * Must correctly extend Employee.
    */
   export class Developer {
     /**
      * @param {string} name - Developer name.
      * @param {number} salary - Base salary.
      * @param {number} bonus - Bonus amount.
      */
     constructor(/* name, salary, bonus */) {
       throwNotImplementedError();
     }
   }
   ```

   Read the task description in the comment above the class/method. Try to understand the idea. You can see the tests prepared if you don't understand it.

7. Write your code in `src/<task-name>.js`.

   Uncomment the incoming parameters:

   ```javascript
    constructor(/* name, salary, bonus */) {...}
   ```

   Remove the throwing error line from function body:

   ```javascript
   throwNotImplementedError();
   ```

   Implement the class/method by any way and verify your solution by running tests until the failed test become passed (green).

8. Run `npm test` in command line. If everything is OK you can try to resolve the next task.

## FAQ

**Question:** I use Windows machine and have received a lot of errors like "Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'". How to handle it?
**Answer**:

- First, you need to install Gitbash properly: you need to choose option "Checkout as-is, commit as-is" in section "Configuring the line ending conversions". It'll let you download repos with line endings set "as-is" as well as commit. In other words, not to change them at all, because by default it converts them.
- Second, install `editorconfig` plugin to your editor. For VS Code you can find it here:
  <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig>
  I'll let you apply some rules when you saving your files in the repo. This plugin will use config-file `.editorconfig` that you can see in the root folder. It lets you save the file with needed line endings, trim whitespaces, etc.
- Finally, you need to apply linter's autofix feature in order to fix all linebreaks that was already changed to "CLRF":
  ```sh
  npm run lint:fix
  ```

**Question:** The solution in the local repository succeeds and all tests are "green", but in the application some tests don't count. What to do?<br>
**Answer**: [Update your repository fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork), update the local repository from the fork, run tests and fix your solution. After fixing, resubmit your solution for testing.

**Question:** How can I run tests for one task, and not all at once?<br>
**Answer**:

```sh
node --test tests/<task-name>.test.js
```
